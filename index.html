    <h2>The History of Ballet</h2>
    <p>Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century, where it began as a form of courtly entertainment. It flourished in France during the reign of Louis XIV, who established the first ballet school, the Académie Royale de Danse, in 1661. From there, ballet developed into a formalized, technical art form, spreading to Russia, where it gained further prominence in the 19th century with renowned composers like Tchaikovsky and choreographers like Marius Petipa. Over the centuries, ballet has evolved, blending classical traditions with modern influences, making it one of the most revered and enduring forms of dance worldwide.
